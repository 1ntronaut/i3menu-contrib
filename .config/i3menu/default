# `font` setting above is internally parsed to dmenu through i3menu
# The syntax for setting to be compatible is:
# font = <fontname> -<fontsize>
#   <fontname>: FullFont Name with Spaces
#   use `fc-list | grep "<fontname>" | cut -d ":" -f2` to search the name of your installed fonts
#   -<fontsize>: -20 on command line, the font size for dmenu can be set by using the `-fn Hack -18` option. Consequently, as it is basically a fancy wrapper for dmenu, this syntax turns out to be appropriately respected by both dmenu and i3menu, when running (your own) i3menu/dmenu scripts
# Above syntax ensures compatibility if i3menu is called from any script, as well as it respects your environment variables if set.
# USAGE 1: respects $I3MENU_DIR/ env variable if set; otherwise defaults to ~/.config/i3menu
# !! MAKE SURE directory ~/.config/i3menu exists, before using i3menu
#   `$ i3menu --theme ./relative/path/to/theme/file`
# SYNTAX should look like this: 
#   `$ i3menu --theme default`
# This command will spawn i3menu, and will use the settings as defined in the file `~/.config/i3menu/default`
# USECASE EXAMPLE 1: i3menu_run ; `dmenu_run` replacement, run commands in you $PATH using i3menu 
# ```sh
# #!/bin/sh
# dmenu_path | i3menu -p "run" --theme default "$@" | ${SHELL:-"/bin/sh"} &
# ````
